        <h1>Questions Answered</h1>

        <p class="lead">Our research answered the key questions about whether a disruption opportunity exists. Here's what we now know.</p>

        <h2>Questions We've Answered</h2>

        <div class="question-card answered">
            <h3>Would families pay for "tourn-acations"?</h3>
            <p>The core question: is there real demand for a better tournament experience?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer: YES.</strong> Families pay 200-300% premiums for predictable, vacation-integrated experiences. Cooperstown charges $10,000/team (vs $400-700 standard). Ripken charges $3,000+/week. Scheduling chaos is parents' #1 complaint, yet they've normalized it. When given the option, they pay for better.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card answered">
            <h3>Would clubs participate in family-first tournaments?</h3>
            <p>Even if families want this, would teams actually register?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer: YES.</strong> Coach shortage is NOT universal. Three segments have dedicated coaching: (1) Premium clubs (ECNL, MLS NEXT) mandate dedicated coaches, (2) Volleyball has built-in dual-coach model, (3) Small volunteer clubs have natural 1:1 ratios. These segments would PREFER wave scheduling.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card answered">
            <h3>Do the economics work?</h3>
            <p>Can a family-first tournament be profitable with lower field utilization?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer: YES.</strong> The math works with 40-60% premium registration + week-long format + destination appeal. Cooperstown sold 80% stake for $116M. Ripken is expanding to 4 locations. Surf Cup generates $120M annual economic impact. Revenue shifts from hotel rebates to premium registration.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card answered">
            <h3>Has anyone tried this and failed?</h3>
            <p>Is there evidence this model doesn't work?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer: NO failures documented.</strong> Volleyball universally adopted wave scheduling with no reversions. No documented cases of family-first tournaments failing because of the model. The barrier is economic structure preference, not proven failure.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card answered">
            <h3>Do families have agency in tournament selection?</h3>
            <p>If coaches/clubs choose tournaments, can families influence the choice?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer: NUANCED but workable.</strong> Coaches make direct decisions, BUT families choose which teams to join. Tournament access is now a recruitment differentiator. Teams market "Cooperstown access" to attract families. Families can vote with their feet at team selection time.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card answered">
            <h3>Can family-first be a competitive advantage?</h3>
            <p>Would "better scheduling" actually drive loyalty and growth?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer: YES.</strong> Dance/cheer competitions now compete on "runs on time." Studios explicitly choose competitions based on scheduling reliability. i9 Sports built $100M+ business on family-first convenience. "No stay-to-play" is a differentiator that Ripken explicitly markets.

        <h2>Remaining Questions</h2>

        <div class="question-card">
            <h3>Which destination markets are underserved?</h3>
            <p>Cooperstown has baseball. Ripken has multiple sports. Where are the gaps?</p>
            <div class="context">
                <strong>What we need:</strong> Market analysis of destination tournament coverage by sport and region. Where is there unmet demand?
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <h3>Build new or partner with existing operators?</h3>
            <p>Should we create tournaments from scratch or partner with existing operators who want to adopt the model?</p>
            <div class="context">
                <strong>What we need:</strong> Conversations with tournament operators about partnership interest. Assessment of build vs. partner economics.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <h3>Which sport/age group to start with?</h3>
            <p>Volleyball already does wave scheduling. Baseball has Cooperstown. What's the best entry point?</p>
            <div class="context">
                <strong>What we need:</strong> Analysis of sport-specific dynamics, club staffing models, and destination appeal by sport.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <h3>How do we acquire the first clubs?</h3>
            <p>Even with a great tournament, how do we get teams to register for something new?</p>
            <div class="context">
                <strong>What we need:</strong> Go-to-market strategy. Relationships with premium clubs, volleyball programs, and small volunteer clubs.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>The key strategic questions are now execution-focused, not validation-focused. The research confirms the opportunity exists. The question is how to capture it.</p>
