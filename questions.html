        <h1>Open Questions</h1>

        <p class="lead">Our research answered some questions and raised new ones. Here's what we now know and what we still need to learn.</p>

        <h2>Questions We've Answered</h2>

        <div class="question-card answered">
            <h3>Why don't more TDs use wave scheduling?</h3>
            <p>We now know the key blockers—and it's not what we assumed.</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> Staggered schedules aren't "bad scheduling"—they're <em>intentional</em>. Large clubs send 15 teams with only 6 coaches. TDs stagger games (U11 at 9am, U12 at 11am, U13 at 2pm) so one coach can cover multiple teams sequentially. Wave scheduling would put all those games in the same 4-hour block, creating overlaps. TDs prioritize big clubs (their main customers) over family convenience. Additional factors: stay-to-play economics (12-hour footprints force hotel stays), parking logistics (wave handoffs cause chaos), and inertia.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card answered">
            <h3>Do families actually want predictable free time?</h3>
            <p>Yes—but it's more nuanced than we thought.</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> 59% of families try to combine tournaments with activities. They DO want this. But: (1) They want GROUP activities with the team, not individual bookings; (2) Bracket unpredictability makes advance booking nearly impossible; (3) Fatigue and cost compression reduce willingness to book; (4) The "parking anchor" keeps them stuck at the venue.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card answered">
            <h3>Is the "hostage experience" real?</h3>
            <p>We validated this with hour-by-hour research.</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. Families spend 60-70% of tournament day NOT watching games. A typical 10-12 hour day includes only 2-3 hours of actual game time. The rest is waiting, driving between fields, and "liminal gaps" of dead time.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>New Questions From Research</h2>

        <div class="question-card">
            <h3>Is "team mom" the right customer?</h3>
            <p>Research suggests families want GROUP activities. The team mom is the one coordinating these. But we haven't validated she'd pay for a tool.</p>
            <div class="context">
                <strong>What we need:</strong> Interviews with team moms. What's their biggest coordination pain? Would they pay for group booking help? How much?
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <h3>Can we work with tournaments that already use wave scheduling?</h3>
            <p>Volleyball, some soccer tournaments already do this. Could we target these tournaments specifically for the activity marketplace?</p>
            <div class="context">
                <strong>What we need:</strong> List of tournaments that already use wave scheduling. Do families at these tournaments book more activities?
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <h3>What kind of "last-minute flexibility" would make activity booking work?</h3>
            <p>Bracket unpredictability is a major blocker. Could we partner with venues that offer flexible cancellation? On-demand booking? Group holds?</p>
            <div class="context">
                <strong>What we need:</strong> Conversations with activity providers (escape rooms, restaurants, mini golf) about flexibility options.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <h3>Can we change the club coaching model?</h3>
            <p>The staggered schedule exists to accommodate under-staffed clubs. Wave scheduling would require clubs to hire more coaches. Is there any way to influence this—or is it a structural reality we must accept?</p>
            <div class="context">
                <strong>What we need:</strong> Understanding of club economics. Why do clubs under-staff coaches? Is it cost? Availability? Would parents pay more for better-staffed clubs?
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Strategic Questions</h2>

        <div class="question-card">
            <h3>Should we pivot from TD to team mom?</h3>
            <p>Our original thesis targeted TDs. Research suggests the team mom might be a better customer. But that's a fundamentally different business.</p>
            <div class="context">
                <strong>What we need:</strong> Founder discussion on whether we want to pursue this pivot.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <h3>What's our unfair advantage now?</h3>
            <p>We have a TD on the team. But if TDs aren't the customer, is that still valuable? What do we know that others don't?</p>
            <div class="context">
                <strong>What we need:</strong> Honest reassessment of our competitive position given new research.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-card">
            <h3>Accept staggered schedules or work around them?</h3>
            <p>Staggered schedules are intentional, not broken. Three options: (1) Accept them and help families cope with the chaos, (2) Target tournaments that already use wave scheduling (volleyball, some soccer), (3) Target smaller tournaments without big-club dependencies. Which is most achievable?</p>
            <div class="context">
                <strong>What we need:</strong> Founder alignment on which strategy to pursue.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>We've made progress—we know more than we did. But each answer has raised new questions. The path forward requires choosing which questions to answer next.</p>
