# RoadGame Market Research Synthesis

## Executive Summary

The youth sports travel market represents a **$52.2 billion direct spending opportunity** (2023), with total economic impact of **$128 billion**. Despite massive scale, the family experience is defined by frustration: mandatory hotel policies, fragmented apps, chaotic schedules, and no tools for the "in-between" moments. The market is ripe for disruption by a **"Tournament Weekend Companion"** that solves for the 16 hours families spend *away* from the playing field.

- Last-minute changes delivered "through the kid"

### 3. App Fatigue & Fragmentation

- No single platform handles scheduling + communication + travel
- Volunteer "Team Mom" bridges the gaps manually

### 4. Group Dining Nightmare
- Finding restaurants that seat 20-30 people

- Split checks chaos
- 90-minute windows between games

### 5. Sibling/Family Neglect

## Direct Parent Quotes (Proof Points)

> "The 'discounted' rate through the portal? $249. Same hotel, same dates, same room—$169 online. But book direct and you're out of compliance."

> "It's a ruthless, blood-sucking money-game and parents are the victims because we want so badly for our kids to be successful."

> "It robs time away from your other kids. It's horrible."

> "I not so secretly wish he could just play on a school team like we did in the good old days."

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Focus | Gap |
|------------|-------|-----|
| **Lucid Travel** | Automated hotel booking, 5% cashback | No discovery, no dining, no family experience |
| **Coordle** | Itinerary + local discovery | B2B model, requires org adoption, limited footprint |
| **Team Travel Source** | Full-service housing agency | High-touch, enforcer of mandates, no family value |
| **Athletes Hospitality** | Wellness-centric booking | Still room-focused, no activities |

### Adjacent Solutions

| Platform | What They Do | What They Don't Do |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **TeamSnap** | Team communication, scheduling | No travel, no discovery |
| **SportsEngine** | Bracket management, registration | Travel is redirect to 3rd party |
| **Expedia/Booking** | General travel | No tournament context, blocked by Stay-to-Play |
| **Yelp/TripAdvisor** | Restaurant discovery | Not "tournament-ready" context |

### The Gap No One Fills
**"Bracket-to-Table" Connection**: No platform links the live tournament bracket to real-time recommendations for restaurants, activities, and downtime options based on actual schedule gaps.

## Marketplace Bootstrapping Lessons

### Pattern 1: Single-Player Mode (Utility First)
- **OpenTable**: Reservation book software useful even with no diners
- **Eventbrite**: Free ticketing tool attracted organizers who brought their own demand
- **RoadGame Application**: Bracket/schedule tool for tournament directors

### Pattern 2: Piggybacking Existing Platforms
- **Airbnb**: Cross-posted to Craigslist, parasitized their traffic
- **Rover/Thumbtack**: Tools to post on Craigslist with link back to platform
- **RoadGame Application**: Target Facebook groups, team coordinator chats

### Pattern 3: Event-Based Bootstrapping
- **Airbnb**: Launched at DNC in Denver (temporary demand spike)
- **Tinder**: Parties at USC fraternities/sororities
- **RoadGame Application**: Launch for ONE premier tournament with 100% density

### Pattern 4: Do Things That Don't Scale
- **Airbnb**: Professional photography of every listing
- **Uber**: Paid drivers to be online with no riders
- **RoadGame Application**: Manually call hotels/restaurants, claim listings for businesses

### Pattern 5: Manufacture Local Authority (SEO)
- **GrubHub**: Offered $10 discounts to local newspapers for backlinks
- **RoadGame Application**: Partner with local restaurants for "Team Meal Deals," get backlinks from tournament sites

## Strategic Implications for RoadGame V1

### The Opportunity
A **"Tournament Weekend Companion"** that:
- Focuses on the **16 hours/day** families spend AWAY from the field
- Provides **real-time, context-aware** recommendations based on schedule
- Solves the **group coordination** problem (dining, activities)
- Adds **transparency and value** to the mandatory lodging experience

### Why Now
1. Market growing 6-10% annually

3. No incumbent owns the "family experience" layer
4. Tournament directors need tools to prove economic impact to cities

### Bootstrap Strategy
1. **Single-player value for tournament director**: Roster management, schedule display
2. **Scrape providers** from Google Places (claim listing model)
3. **Focus on ONE tournament** to achieve 100% density
4. **Social proof**: Show "X teammates interested" to drive group coordination
5. **Prove demand to providers**: "You had 50 views" → claim your listing

## Summary: The RoadGame Thesis

The youth sports travel market is a **$52B captive audience** experiencing systematic frustration. Current solutions focus on the **tournament organizer** (housing mandates, registration) or the **athlete** (stats, brackets).

**No one is solving for the family.**

RoadGame will own the **"in-between moments"**: the 3-hour gap between games, the team dinner coordination, the sibling entertainment, the "where do we eat" question asked 10 times per weekend.

By providing value to families first (via scraped listings and social coordination) and proving demand to providers second (via engagement data), RoadGame can bootstrap a two-sided marketplace without solving the chicken-and-egg problem through traditional means.

**The goal is not to replace Stay-to-Play—it's to make the mandated experience actually better than the opt-out experience.**
