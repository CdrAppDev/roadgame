## Prompt 4: Marketplace Bootstrapping Case Studies

**Save results as:** `04-marketplace-bootstrapping-case-studies.md`

```
Research how successful two-sided marketplaces solved the "chicken and egg" cold-start problem.

I'm building a two-sided marketplace connecting:
- DEMAND SIDE: Families traveling to youth sports tournaments
- SUPPLY SIDE: Hotels, restaurants, and activities near tournament venues

I need to understand how other marketplaces bootstrapped when they had no supply and no demand.

Research these specific companies and their early strategies:

1. YELP
- How did they get initial business listings before they had users?
- The "claim your listing" model - how did it work?
- How did they drive initial traffic?

2. OPENTABLE
- How did they get restaurants to sign up before diners were using it?
- What was their initial value proposition to restaurants?
- Hardware/software angle - how did this help?

3. AIRBNB
- Early growth tactics (Craigslist, professional photography)
- How did they get initial hosts and guests?
- Geographic focus strategy

4. THUMBTACK
- How did they get service providers before customers?
- Lead generation model evolution

5. OTHER RELEVANT CASES
- GrubHub/DoorDash - restaurant aggregation
- Rover - pet sitters
- Any travel/tourism marketplaces
- Eventbrite or similar event-based platforms

For each company, document:
- The cold-start problem they faced
- Their specific bootstrap strategy
- Which side they focused on first (supply or demand)
- How they created value for one side before the other existed
- Timeline from launch to critical mass
- Key lessons learned

Also research:
- Academic papers or articles on marketplace cold-start strategies
- VC/investor perspectives on marketplace bootstrapping
- Common patterns across successful marketplaces

Focus on actionable tactics, not just high-level strategy.
