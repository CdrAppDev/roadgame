# Wave scheduling in youth sports: volleyball's success and why other sports resist

Volleyball stands alone among youth sports in widely adopting wave scheduling—the practice of grouping teams into concentrated morning or afternoon time blocks—while soccer, baseball, softball, and basketball have systematically resisted it. The difference stems not from ignorance but from fundamental structural factors: volleyball's unique team-officiating system, indoor multi-court facilities, and predictable match durations create conditions that simply don't exist in outdoor field sports. For families hoping for reform, the path forward requires understanding both why volleyball's model works and why the economic incentives in other sports actively discourage family-friendly scheduling.

## Volleyball cracked the code with a self-contained system

Youth volleyball tournaments across the United States operate almost universally on an AM/PM wave format: morning waves typically run 8am-2pm, afternoon waves from 3pm-9pm. Teams arrive, play 2-4 matches within their designated window, and leave. The Junior Volleyball Association explicitly recommends this structure, and regional organizations from Northern California (NCVA) to Southern California (SCVN) to Arizona to Kansas City all follow it.

The system works because volleyball has something no other sport possesses: **the play-work-off rotation**. In a typical 3- or 4-team pool, one team plays while another team provides referees, scorekeepers, and line judges (the "work" assignment), and a third team rests. This rotation binds teams together in self-contained time blocks. Unlike soccer or baseball where professional referees are scheduled for specific games, volleyball teams officiate each other—creating both cost savings and scheduling interdependence that makes wave scheduling not just possible but natural.

Several other factors reinforce this:

- **Predictable match duration**: Rally scoring means best-of-3 matches consistently run 45-60 minutes
- **Multi-court indoor venues**: Conventions centers host 40-70+ courts simultaneously
- **Pool play structure**: Round-robin pools followed by bracket play fits naturally into wave formats
- **Team size**: 6-player rosters can staff all officiating positions without strain

USA Volleyball's Sunshine Classic exemplifies the model: Courts 1-70 run AM waves while Courts 71-142 host PM waves. Teams know weeks in advance whether they're assigned to morning or afternoon, allowing families to plan their day rather than wait for scattered game times.

## Soccer, baseball, and basketball face structural barriers—but also choose not to overcome them

Youth soccer, baseball, softball, and basketball tournaments overwhelmingly reject wave scheduling, citing a combination of logistical impossibilities and economic preferences that tournament directors present as insurmountable constraints.

**The geographic problem** dominates outdoor sports. While volleyball tournaments occupy single convention centers, soccer and baseball fields scatter across municipal parks, school grounds, and private facilities—often miles apart within a single tournament. A 2014 BigSoccer forum discussion captured this precisely: "In Northern Virginia, games are scattered all over the county, so the idea that the Technical Director could be in one place to oversee all the games was not realistic." This fragmentation makes coordinated waves logistically difficult.

**Variable game duration** creates scheduling chaos in ways volleyball doesn't face. Baseball games have no time limits—they can end early via run rules or extend through extra innings and weather delays. Soccer adds stoppage time, extra time, and shootouts. A tournament that tries to compress games into defined waves risks cascading delays when one match runs long.

**Field economics favor maximum utilization**, not family convenience. Tournament directors rent fields by specific time slots, often paying premium rates for lighting. The economic incentive pushes toward cramming maximum games per field per day rather than spacing them into family-friendly blocks. As one youth soccer consultant bluntly stated: "Why do tournaments exist in the first place? The main reason we have tournaments is money. Some clubs even rely on one annual tournament to ensure their financial survival the rest of the year."

**The referee structure differs fundamentally**. While volleyball teams officiate each other for free (or minimal stipend), outdoor field sports rely on paid officials assigned per game—typically $25-70+ per game depending on sport and level. This creates no incentive for concentrated scheduling and actually encourages spreading games throughout the day to maximize official assignments.

Gate admission and concession revenue models also quietly shape scheduling. Perfect Game baseball tournaments charge spectators $10 per day to walk onto fields—a model that maximizes hours of family presence, not efficient departure. Hotels bundled with "stay-to-play" requirements generate additional tournament revenue when families must remain overnight between scattered games.

## Governing bodies set minimal standards, leaving directors discretion they use for profit

The absence of strong scheduling mandates from youth sports governing bodies represents both a policy failure and a deliberate choice. Only two organizations set explicit, measurable rest requirements:

**USA Hockey** mandates the clearest rules: minimum 4 hours between games on the same day and 12 hours between games on consecutive days. Their rationale explicitly cites "health, safety, and skill development" and recommends all youth hockey tournaments adopt these minimums.

**USSSA Baseball** requires mandatory rest days for pitchers: any player throwing more than 3 innings must rest the next day, with violations resulting in immediate game forfeiture. This specificity reflects baseball's particular injury risks but doesn't extend to overall tournament scheduling.

Most governing bodies defer to tournament directors. **US Youth Soccer** limits teams to 2 games per day but leaves timing discretion to organizers. **US Club Soccer** requires "adequate rest time between games" without defining what adequate means—tournament directors decide. **USA Volleyball** sets no minimum rest requirements at all, relying instead on the wave system's natural structure. **AAU** provides no national scheduling standard, treating tournament operators as "independent contractors responsible for the management and conduct of the event."

This regulatory vacuum lets economic incentives dominate. When no governing body mandates family-friendly scheduling, and tournament revenue depends on maximizing field utilization and gate fees, directors face no pressure to change.

## Tournament directors cite real constraints while benefiting from the status quo

Tournament director perspectives reveal a mix of genuine operational challenges and convenient economic rationalizations. The term "wave scheduling" itself rarely appears in their discussions—the concept seems unfamiliar or not part of their vocabulary.

**Ricky Becker**, a tennis tournament director, articulated the fairness argument: "It's not fair to the child's opponent to have to play their second match against an opponent who is playing their first match of the day." This legitimate concern—that some teams would arrive fresh for their wave while others have already played—could theoretically be addressed through consistent wave assignments, but directors cite it as a barrier rather than a solvable problem.

**Referee shortages** compound scheduling inflexibility. **Ryan Maloney**, Southeast Director for Soccer Management Company, identified referee abuse as "easily the most pressing issue," driving older officials out and making younger ones quit. When referee availability is limited and declining, directors lose the slack that would enable creative scheduling.

**Facility constraints** are real but vary. Some parks charge per field, others by day. Lighting adds cost. Multiple organizations compete for the same facilities. Directors build formats around these constraints rather than advocating for family-friendly alternatives.

What directors rarely acknowledge is how traditional scheduling serves their financial interests. Compressed, all-day tournaments maximize games per field per day. Spreading games across morning and afternoon forces families to stay longer, spending on concessions and filling hotel partner blocks. The economic structure rewards intensive scheduling even when directors personally recognize its costs to families and players.

Notably, **no documented cases of wave scheduling being tried and abandoned in outdoor sports** emerged from research. The failure to adopt isn't a story of failed experiments—it's a story of never trying.

## Reform emerges from outside the tournament industry

The strongest push for family-friendly youth sports comes not from tournament operators but from advocacy organizations and alternative models that sidestep traditional tournament economics entirely.

**i9 Sports**, founded in 2004 with over 1 million members, operates on a one-day-per-week model where practice and games happen on the same Saturday or Sunday. No tryouts, no travel, no tournament weekends consuming entire families. The franchise explicitly positions itself against travel sports culture with the tagline "The Way Youth Sports Should Be."

**The Aspen Institute's Project Play** has become the leading research and advocacy voice, creating the "Children's Bill of Rights in Sports" endorsed by 500+ organizations including the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee, YMCA, and Little League. Their State of Play reports document troubling trends: youth sports costs up 46% since 2019 (now averaging $1,016/year), and 70% of children dropping out of organized sports by age 13.

**Positive Coaching Alliance**, partnered with AAU since 2010, provides coach education emphasizing the "Double-Goal Coach" model—winning while teaching life lessons. While not directly addressing tournament scheduling, PCA has helped shift cultural expectations toward player welfare.

**US Youth Soccer announced a 2025-26 format change** explicitly designed to "reduce travel demands and ease the overall burden on families"—eliminating the Regional Championship round so State Cup champions advance directly to Nationals. The language marks a notable shift: a major governing body publicly acknowledging family burden as a problem worth solving.

## Early signs of generational change appear, but economics lag behind culture

Evidence suggests millennial parents—now raising the majority of youth athletes—approach sports differently than previous generations. Casual sport participation has increased 6% in recent years. Flag football grew 14% from 2019-2024, the only team sport showing consistent growth. Parents increasingly research burnout, overuse injuries, and early specialization risks.

The Million Coaches Challenge, launched in 2021, trained 1 million coaches in positive youth development by 2025. Research shows 93% of trained coaches feel more confident and athletes report more joy—cultural shifts that could eventually pressure tournament operators.

**Latino households** cite scheduling conflicts more than non-Latino families as barriers to sports participation, according to Aspen Institute research—suggesting demand for flexibility exists but isn't being met.

Yet structural economics haven't shifted. Travel soccer still costs $2,000-5,000+ per year versus $65-250 for recreational leagues. Tournament operators still depend on hotel partnerships and gate fees. The referee shortage continues pushing schedules into whatever windows officials are available rather than what families prefer.

## Conditions enabling wave scheduling remain unique to volleyball

The research reveals that wave scheduling isn't a simple best practice that other sports could adopt with better intentions. It requires:

1. **Team-based officiating** eliminating dependence on paid referees
2. **Centralized multi-court facilities** enabling coordinated waves
3. **Predictable game durations** allowing reliable time blocks
4. **Pool play structures** that bind teams together in self-contained units
5. **Cultural acceptance** of the play-work-off rotation

Outdoor field sports lack most of these conditions. More importantly, their economic structures actively discourage change. Tournament directors face club pressure to host events regardless of family impact ("some clubs rely on one annual tournament to ensure their financial survival"), parent pressure to provide tournament opportunities ("other clubs will play tournaments and we don't"), and facility economics that reward maximum utilization.

## Conclusion

Wave scheduling represents a genuine innovation in volleyball that no other major youth sport has successfully replicated—not because alternatives haven't been imagined, but because the enabling conditions don't exist and the economic incentives point the other way. Volleyball's team-officiating system, indoor multi-court venues, and predictable match lengths created structural possibilities that tournament organizers exploited to everyone's benefit. Soccer, baseball, and basketball face real barriers in scattered fields, variable game lengths, and referee economics—but they also benefit financially from keeping families on-site all day.

Reform pressure is building from advocacy organizations, millennial parent expectations, and governing bodies newly acknowledging family burden. But until tournament economics shift—through facility subsidies, referee reform, or governing body mandates with teeth—family-friendly scheduling will remain the exception rather than the norm outside volleyball courts. The 70% dropout rate by age 13 suggests the current model is unsustainable. Whether that recognition translates into structural change remains an open question that families, clubs, and governing bodies will answer in the coming years.
