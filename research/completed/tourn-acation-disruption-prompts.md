# Tourn-acation Disruption Research Prompts

## Research Objective

Validate or invalidate the hypothesis that a "family-first" tournament model could disrupt the youth sports tournament market by offering predictable free time (wave scheduling) that enables advance group activity booking.

**Core Thesis:** The current tournament status quo (chaotic schedules, no family time) exists because there's no disruptive alternative—not because families prefer it. A tournament built for families could capture market share.

## Prompt 1: Tournament Selection Decision-Making

**Research Question:** Who has the power to choose which tournaments a team attends—coaches/clubs or families?

**Prompt:**
```
Research how youth travel sports teams decide which tournaments to attend. I need to understand the decision-making dynamics between coaches, club administrators, and families.

Specifically investigate:

1. Who makes the final decision on tournament selection for travel teams in soccer, baseball, softball, volleyball, and hockey?

2. How much input do families have in tournament selection? Can they veto? Do they vote? Or do they just follow what the coach/club decides?

3. Are there examples of families choosing to skip tournaments the team selected, or families pushing back on tournament choices?

4. Do families ever choose teams BECAUSE of the tournaments they attend? (i.e., tournament schedule as a selling point for club recruitment)

5. What factors do coaches/clubs prioritize when selecting tournaments? (competition level, cost, location, exposure, scheduling)

6. Are there differences by sport, age group, or competition level (rec vs elite)?

Search for:
- Parent forum discussions about tournament selection
- Coach/club administrator perspectives on scheduling
- Team recruitment materials mentioning tournament schedules
- Academic research on youth sports decision-making
- Industry articles about tournament selection criteria

Provide specific quotes, examples, and sources. Note any patterns where families DO have agency vs where they don't.

## Prompt 2: Family Willingness to Pay for Better Experiences

**Research Question:** Would families pay more, travel further, or choose differently for a tournament with predictable free time and family-friendly scheduling?

**Prompt:**
```
Research whether youth sports families would pay a premium or make different choices for tournaments that offer predictable free time, family-friendly scheduling, and the ability to plan activities in advance.

Specifically investigate:

1. Do families express willingness to pay more for better tournament experiences? What would "better" mean to them?

2. Are there examples of premium-priced tournaments that market themselves on family experience rather than just competition quality? How do they perform?

3. When families compare tournaments, do scheduling factors (game times, rest periods, predictability) influence their preferences?

4. Would families travel further to attend a tournament with better scheduling if local options had poor schedules?

5. What trade-offs would families accept for predictable free time?
   - Lower competition level?
   - Higher cost?
   - Longer travel distance?
   - Smaller tournament size?

6. Have any tournaments tried to market "family-first" scheduling as a differentiator? What happened?

Search for:
- Parent discussions comparing tournament experiences
- Tournament reviews mentioning scheduling quality
- Premium tournament marketing materials
- Surveys or research on family tournament preferences
- "Best tournaments" lists and what criteria they use

Provide specific quotes about what families value and what they'd pay for. Note any evidence of price sensitivity vs experience sensitivity.
```

## Prompt 3: Existing Disruption Attempts in Youth Sports

**Research Question:** Has anyone tried to create family-first or wave-scheduled tournaments? What happened?

**Prompt:**
```
Research any attempts to disrupt the traditional youth sports tournament model with family-friendly scheduling, wave scheduling, or "tourn-acation" style events.

Specifically investigate:

1. Are there tournament operators who explicitly market family-friendly scheduling or predictable free time? Who are they and how are they doing?

2. What happened to tournaments that tried wave scheduling or block scheduling? Did they succeed, fail, or revert to traditional models?

3. Are there "destination tournaments" that combine competition with planned family activities? (Disney, beach locations, resort tournaments) How do they structure schedules?

4. Have any new tournament brands emerged that differentiate on family experience rather than competition prestige?

5. What do tournament operators say about why they DON'T offer family-friendly scheduling? What are their stated reasons?

6. Are there examples from other youth activities (dance, cheer, music) where family-friendly scheduling became a competitive advantage?

7. Have any tournaments failed specifically because they tried to change the scheduling model? What went wrong?

Search for:
- Tournament operator interviews and perspectives
- "Destination tournament" marketing and structures
- Failed tournament ventures and post-mortems
- Innovation in youth sports event management
- Comparisons between traditional and alternative tournament formats

Provide specific examples of attempts (successful or failed) and analyze why they succeeded or failed.

## Prompt 4: Tournament Operator Economics and Business Model

**Research Question:** What does it take to run a youth sports tournament? Could a new entrant compete with a different model?

**Prompt:**
```
Research the business model and economics of youth sports tournament operation. I need to understand whether a new entrant could viably compete with a family-first model.

Specifically investigate:

1. What are the primary revenue streams for tournament operators?
   - Registration fees
   - Gate fees
   - Vendor/concession fees
   - Hotel rebates (stay-to-play kickbacks)
   - Sponsorships

2. What are the major cost drivers?
   - Field/facility rental
   - Referees and officials
   - Insurance
   - Marketing and administration
   - Awards and operations

3. How dependent are tournament operators on large clubs? What percentage of registrations come from big clubs vs independent teams?

4. What's the typical margin for a tournament operator? Is this a high-margin or low-margin business?

5. How do new tournaments get started? What's the barrier to entry? How do they attract teams initially?

6. Are there tournament operators who have grown significantly in recent years? What did they do differently?

7. What would change economically if a tournament used wave scheduling?
   - Fewer games per field per day?
   - Different field rental needs?
   - Impact on hotel partnerships?

Search for:
- Tournament operator business guides and resources
- Industry reports on youth sports economics
- Interviews with tournament directors about their business
- Tournament startup stories and challenges
- Financial discussions about running tournaments

Provide specific numbers where available (registration fees, field costs, margins). Note what would need to be true economically for a family-first model to work.
```

## Prompt 5: Club Staffing Models and Variance

**Research Question:** Are there clubs that are properly staffed (enough coaches) and would benefit from wave scheduling? Or is understaffing universal?

**Prompt:**
```
Research the staffing models of youth travel sports clubs. I need to understand whether the coach-shortage problem (one coach covering multiple teams) is universal or if there are well-staffed clubs that would prefer wave scheduling.

Specifically investigate:

1. What's the typical coach-to-team ratio at youth travel clubs? How does this vary by club size, sport, and competition level?

2. Are there clubs that explicitly staff each team with dedicated coaches who don't need to cover multiple age groups?

3. Do "premier" or high-end clubs have better staffing ratios? Would they prefer wave scheduling since their coaches don't need to hop between teams?

4. How do smaller clubs (1-3 teams) handle coaching compared to large clubs (10+ teams)? Do smaller clubs have different scheduling preferences?

5. Are there regions or sports where proper staffing is more common? (e.g., volleyball vs baseball, East Coast vs Midwest)

6. Have any clubs complained about tournaments NOT using wave scheduling because it would actually work better for them?

7. What would it take for an understaffed club to bring additional coaches to a tournament? Cost? Availability? Would they do it for a better family experience?

Search for:
- Club staffing discussions and job postings
- Coach-to-team ratio data by club type
- Parent complaints about coaching coverage at tournaments
- Club marketing that emphasizes dedicated coaching staff
- Regional or sport-specific staffing differences

Identify whether there's a segment of clubs (smaller, premium, specific sports) that would be early adopters of wave-scheduled tournaments.
```

## Prompt 6: The "Destination Tournament" Model Deep Dive

**Research Question:** How do destination tournaments (Disney, beach, resort) structure their events? Do they solve the family time problem?

**Prompt:**
```
Research "destination tournaments" in youth sports—events held at vacation destinations like Disney, beach towns, or resort areas. Understand how they balance competition with family vacation time.

Specifically investigate:

1. How do destination tournaments structure their schedules? Do they build in family time, or is it the same chaos in a nicer location?

2. What's the price premium for destination tournaments vs standard regional tournaments? How much more do families pay?

3. Do families actually use destination tournaments as vacations? Or do they end up trapped at the fields like any other tournament?

4. Which destination tournament operators are most successful? (Disney, Gulf Shores, Myrtle Beach, etc.) What do they do differently?

5. Do destination tournaments use wave scheduling or other family-friendly practices? If not, why not?

6. What do families say about destination tournament experiences? Do they feel like vacations or just tournaments in vacation spots?

7. Are destination tournaments growing faster than traditional tournaments? Is there market momentum toward this model?

Search for:
- Disney Cup, Gulf Shores, Myrtle Beach, and other destination tournament reviews
- Parent experiences at destination tournaments
- Destination tournament marketing and scheduling approaches
- Price comparisons between destination and standard tournaments
- Growth trends in destination youth sports events

Analyze whether destination tournaments have cracked the "tourn-acation" code or if they're just regular tournaments with palm trees.

## Prompt 7: Wave Scheduling Adoption and Resistance

**Research Question:** Where has wave scheduling been adopted in youth sports? What drove adoption? What drives resistance?

**Prompt:**
```
Research the adoption and resistance to wave scheduling (also called block scheduling or pool scheduling) in youth sports tournaments.

Specifically investigate:

1. Which sports have widely adopted wave scheduling? (Note: volleyball is mentioned as common) Why did it work there?

2. Which sports have resisted wave scheduling? Why? What are the stated objections?

3. Are there specific tournament organizations or regions known for family-friendly scheduling? What makes them different?

4. What do tournament directors say about why they don't use wave scheduling? Collect their specific objections and reasoning.

5. When wave scheduling has been tried and abandoned, what went wrong? Was it club pressure, economic issues, or something else?

6. Have any governing bodies (USYS, USSSA, etc.) mandated or recommended scheduling standards? What do they say about rest periods and family time?

7. Is there a generational or cultural shift happening? Are newer tournament operators more likely to adopt family-friendly scheduling?

Search for:
- Tournament director forums and discussions
- Sport-specific scheduling standards and guidelines
- Comparisons of scheduling approaches across sports
- Governing body recommendations on tournament structure
- Trend analysis in tournament scheduling practices

Map out where wave scheduling works, where it doesn't, and what conditions enable or prevent adoption.

## Prompt 8: Family-First as Competitive Advantage in Adjacent Markets

**Research Question:** In other family-intensive activities, has "family-first" scheduling become a competitive differentiator?

**Prompt:**
```
Research whether family-friendly scheduling has become a competitive advantage in youth activities adjacent to sports—such as dance, cheer, gymnastics, music, theater, or academic competitions.

Specifically investigate:

1. In competitive dance or cheer, do some competitions differentiate on family-friendly scheduling? How do families respond?

2. Have any youth activity organizers explicitly marketed "family time" or "sibling-friendly" scheduling as a selling point?

3. Are there examples of new entrants disrupting established competition formats by being more family-friendly?

4. What do families in dance/cheer/music say about scheduling compared to sports families? Are their pain points similar?

5. Have any activity organizations been disrupted by competitors who offered better family experiences?

6. Are there hybrid "competition + experience" events that have succeeded? (e.g., competition in the morning, group activity in the afternoon)

Search for:
- Dance/cheer competition parent forums
- Competition organizer marketing emphasizing family experience
- Disruption stories in youth activity markets
- Cross-industry comparisons of scheduling practices
- "Best competition" rankings that include family experience factors

Find examples where family-first became a market advantage to inform whether it could work in sports.

## Key Validation Criteria

The disruption thesis is **validated** if research shows:
- ✅ Families have meaningful agency in tournament selection (or would switch teams for better tournaments)
- ✅ Families would pay more / travel further for predictable free time
- ✅ There's a segment of clubs (smaller, premium, specific sports) that would participate
- ✅ The economics work for a new entrant
- ✅ No one has tried this properly yet (or attempts failed for fixable reasons)

The disruption thesis is **invalidated** if research shows:
- ❌ Families have no agency—clubs choose everything
- ❌ Families say they want better scheduling but won't pay for it or choose it
- ❌ Destination tournaments already tried this and it didn't change behavior
- ❌ The economics require big club participation, which requires traditional scheduling
- ❌ Someone already tried this well and it failed for fundamental reasons
