# Schedule Hostage Validation Research

These prompts specifically target validating (or invalidating) our core thesis: that scattered tournament schedules prevent families from booking activities, and that solving this creates a business opportunity.

## Prompt 1: The Scattered Schedule Problem - Is It Real?

**Save results as:** `05-scattered-schedule-validation.md`

```
Research whether "scattered schedules" at youth sports tournaments is a real, articulated pain point that families complain about.

CONTEXT:
We believe families spend 10+ hours at tournament venues but only watch 3 hours of actual games. The rest is "dead time" - waiting between scattered games (e.g., 8am, 2pm, 6pm). We think this prevents them from doing other activities.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

1. DO FAMILIES COMPLAIN ABOUT SCATTERED SCHEDULES SPECIFICALLY?
- Search Reddit (r/youthsoccer, r/Homeplate, r/hockeyparents, r/Parenting)
- Search youth sports forums and Facebook groups
- Look for phrases like: "dead time," "waiting around," "schedule is terrible," "gaps between games," "8 hours at the field"
- Capture exact quotes that mention schedule frustration

2. HOW DOES THIS RANK VS OTHER COMPLAINTS?
- When families complain about tournaments, what are the TOP complaints?
- Is scheduling in the top 3? Top 5? Or rarely mentioned?
- Compare frequency of schedule complaints vs: cost, politics, burnout, travel distance, hotel policies

3. WHAT DO FAMILIES DO DURING DOWNTIME?
- How do they currently spend gaps between games?
- Do they leave the venue or stay?
- Do they WANT to do activities, or are they too tired?
- Are they frustrated by the dead time, or do they accept it as normal?

4. HAVE FAMILIES TRIED TO SOLVE THIS?
- Do they ask for specific game times when registering?
- Do they complain to tournament directors?
- Have any families said "I wish games were clustered together"?

5. COUNTEREVIDENCE
- Are there families who LIKE having gaps? (rest time, sibling activities)
- Is the "hostage" framing accurate, or do families have more agency than we think?

Capture direct quotes with source links. I want to know if this is a REAL problem families articulate, or an ASSUMED problem we invented.

## Prompt 2: Wave Scheduling - What Exists and Why Isn't It Everywhere?

**Save results as:** `06-wave-scheduling-analysis.md`

```
Research "wave scheduling" or "session scheduling" at youth sports tournaments - where teams play all their games in a morning block OR afternoon block, rather than scattered throughout the day.

CONTEXT:
We've discovered that wave scheduling already exists at some tournaments (e.g., Poughkeepsie Columbus Day Tournament has offered morning/afternoon sessions since 1988). If this is possible, why isn't it standard?

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

1. WHICH TOURNAMENTS USE WAVE/SESSION SCHEDULING?
- Find specific examples of tournaments that offer morning or afternoon sessions
- Which sports? Which regions?
- How long have they been doing this?
- How do they market it?

2. FAMILY RECEPTION
- What do parents say about tournaments that use wave scheduling?
- Do they prefer it? Pay more for it? Specifically seek it out?
- Any complaints about wave scheduling? (e.g., everyone wants morning)

3. WHY DON'T MORE TOURNAMENTS USE IT?
- What do tournament directors say about wave scheduling?
- Is it a technical/logistical problem?
- Is it a preference problem? (coaches want specific times)
- Is it a field capacity problem?
- Is there just no demand?

4. SCHEDULING SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES
- Can existing scheduling software (Fastbreak AI, National Sports ID, SportsEngine) create wave schedules?
- Is this a feature that exists but isn't used?
- What do scheduling platforms say about clustering games?

5. THE REAL BLOCKER
- If wave scheduling is possible and beneficial, what's actually stopping adoption?
- Is it inertia? Politics? Complexity? No financial incentive?
- What would it take for a TD to switch?

Focus on tournament director perspectives, not just parent perspectives. Find industry articles, TD forums, scheduling software documentation.

## Prompt 3: The Activity Booking Problem - Would They Actually Book?

**Save results as:** `07-activity-booking-validation.md`

```
Research whether families at youth sports tournaments actually WANT to book activities, restaurants, or excursions during their free time - and what prevents them from doing so.

CONTEXT:
Our thesis assumes: if we give families predictable free time, they'll book activities. But maybe they're too tired. Maybe they just want to rest. Maybe cost is prohibitive. We need to validate this.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

1. DO FAMILIES CURRENTLY DO ACTIVITIES DURING TOURNAMENTS?
- What do families actually do between games and after games end?
- Do they explore the host city? Stay at the hotel? Go to restaurants?
- Is this common or rare?

2. DO THEY WANT TO DO MORE?
- Search for parents saying "I wish we had time to do X"
- Search for posts about "making it a mini-vacation"
- Do families view tournaments as potential family trips, or just obligations?

3. WHAT STOPS THEM FROM BOOKING NOW?
- Unpredictable schedules?
- Cost constraints?
- Fatigue (kids too tired)?
- Lack of information about what's nearby?
- Too hard to coordinate with other families?
- Don't want to miss games?

4. TEAM DINNERS AND GROUP ACTIVITIES
- How common are team dinners at tournaments?
- Who organizes them? How?
- What goes wrong?
- Would teams pay for help coordinating group activities?

5. THE TEAM MOM PERSPECTIVE
- How do team managers/moms currently organize off-field activities?
- What tools do they use?
- What's the hardest part?
- Would they pay for a service that helps?

Find direct quotes from team coordinators, team moms, and parents about organizing group activities. This is critical to understanding if there's real demand.

## Prompt 4: Tournament Director Incentives - What Would Make Them Change?

**Save results as:** `08-tournament-director-incentives.md`

```
Research what motivates tournament directors (TDs) and what would incentivize them to change how they schedule tournaments or enhance the family experience.

CONTEXT:
Our model may require TDs to adopt new scheduling or partner with us. We need to understand: What do TDs care about? What would make them change?

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

1. WHAT DO TOURNAMENT DIRECTORS CARE ABOUT?
- Revenue? (registration fees, sponsors)
- Reputation? (teams return year after year)
- Operational simplicity?
- Field/venue relationships?
- What metrics do they track?

2. CURRENT REVENUE MODELS
- How do TDs make money?
- Registration fees - what's typical?
- Sponsor revenue?
- Vendor/concession revenue?
- Hotel kickbacks (stay-to-play)?
- What percentage of revenue comes from each source?

3. FAMILY EXPERIENCE - IS IT THEIR PROBLEM?
- Do TDs see family experience as their responsibility?
- Do they get feedback about schedules, wait times, etc.?
- Do they act on this feedback?
- Is there competitive pressure to improve experience?

4. WHAT WOULD MAKE THEM CHANGE?
- More revenue?
- Less operational complexity?
- Competitive pressure (other tournaments do it)?
- Parent/team demand?
- What's been tried before and failed?

5. TD PAIN POINTS
- What frustrates tournament directors?
- Scheduling conflicts?
- Team no-shows?
- Weather contingencies?
- Referee shortages?
- Unhappy parents?

Search for TD forums, tournament organizer content, sports facility management articles, interviews with tournament directors.

## Prompt 5: The "Hostage" Experience - Mapping the Tournament Day

**Save results as:** `09-tournament-day-mapping.md`

```
Research what a typical tournament day actually looks like for a youth sports family. Map out the experience hour by hour to understand where pain points occur.

CONTEXT:
We describe families as "hostage to the schedule" - but what does that really mean? We need to understand the actual experience to validate our assumptions.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

1. TYPICAL DAY TIMELINE
- What time do families arrive at the venue?
- How long before games do they need to arrive?
- How long are games? (by sport)
- How long between games?
- What time do they typically finish?
- When do they get schedule updates?

2. THE WAITING EXPERIENCE
- Where do families wait between games?
- What facilities are available? (shade, seating, food)
- How far are they from hotels/restaurants?
- Can they leave and come back easily?
- What do they do during 2-3 hour gaps?

3. SCHEDULE UNPREDICTABILITY
- How often do schedules change?
- When do families find out their schedule? (day before? morning of?)
- How do weather delays affect things?
- Bracket play vs pool play - how does this affect predictability?

4. THE SIBLING EXPERIENCE
- What do non-playing siblings do all day?
- Is this a major pain point?
- How do families manage multiple children at tournaments?

5. END OF DAY
- When families finish for the day, what do they do?
- How tired are they?
- Do they have energy for activities?
- Is evening a better time for activities than between games?

Find blog posts, vlogs, photo journals, or detailed accounts from parents about "a day at the tournament." I want to understand the lived experience.

## Priority Order

Run these in order of importance for validation:

1. **Prompt 1** - Is the scattered schedule problem real? (most critical)
2. **Prompt 3** - Would they actually book activities?
3. **Prompt 2** - Why isn't wave scheduling everywhere already?
4. **Prompt 5** - What's the actual experience?
5. **Prompt 4** - TD incentives (important for business model)

## What We're Looking For

**Evidence that VALIDATES our thesis:**
- Parents explicitly complaining about scattered schedules
- Parents saying they wish they could do activities but can't due to unpredictability
- Team moms struggling to coordinate group outings
- Families treating tournaments as "mini-vacations" they want to maximize

**Evidence that INVALIDATES our thesis:**
- Parents who prefer gaps (rest time)
- Families who don't want to do activities (too tired, too expensive)
- Wave scheduling exists but families don't care about it
- Team coordination happens easily with existing tools
- TDs have no interest in changing scheduling practices

**We need to be honest about what we find.**
