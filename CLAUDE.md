# RoadGame Project Context

## Current State (December 2024)

### DISRUPTION THESIS VALIDATED

Research confirms family-first destination tournaments work at scale:
- Cooperstown: $116M valuation
- Ripken Experience: 350,000+ guests/year
- Surf Cup: $120M annual economic impact

**The opportunity is to apply/expand a proven model, not invent something new.**

## Key Validated Findings

| Question | Answer | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Would families pay for tourn-acations? | **YES** | 2-3x premiums (Cooperstown $10K/team) |
| Do families want group experiences? | **YES** | Team is social unit |
| Would clubs participate? | **YES** | Premium/volleyball/small clubs have dedicated coaching |
| Does the model work economically? | **YES** | 40-60% premium + destination + week-long |
| Has anyone tried and failed? | **NO** | No documented failures of wave scheduling |

## Strategic Options

### Option A: Create Family-First Tournaments
Build or partner to create destination "tourn-acation" tournaments.

- Genuine vacation destination (beach, Disney, mountains)
- Week-long format with guaranteed free time
- 40-60% premium pricing
- No stay-to-play (differentiator)
- Target: premium clubs, volleyball, small clubs

### Option B: Group Booking Platform
Accept chaos, help team moms book group activities. (Original pivot - still valid but smaller opportunity)

### Option C: Hybrid
Group booking first (faster), tournament partnerships second (bigger).

## What Was Invalidated

- Wave scheduling is NOT novel (exists since 1988)
- TDs will NOT adopt better scheduling (club coaching model blocks it)
- Staggered schedules are INTENTIONAL accommodation

## What Was Validated

- $52B market, families spend $1,200-1,500/tournament weekend
- Scheduling chaos is parents' #1 complaint
- 60-70% of tournament day is NOT watching games
- Families want GROUP experiences (team), not solo tourism
- Wave scheduling works in volleyball (no reversions)
- Premium clubs, volleyball, small clubs have dedicated coaching
- Families will pay 2-3x premiums for predictable time
- "No stay-to-play" is a competitive differentiator

## GitHub Issues

- #35 - Founder Alignment on V1 Proposal
- #36 - Customer Discovery: Team Mom Interviews
- #37 - Customer Discovery: Activity Provider Interviews
- #38 - Research: Wave Scheduling Tournaments

## Next Steps

1. **Founder alignment** on strategic direction (A, B, or C)
2. If disruption: Identify destination + potential tournament partners
3. If group booking: Customer discovery with team moms + providers
4. If hybrid: Sequence appropriately
