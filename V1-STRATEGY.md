# RoadGame V1 Strategy

## Executive Summary

RoadGame is a **smart tournament scheduling platform** that gives Tournament Directors a powerful tool to manage complex scheduling, enables teams to purchase VIP scheduling for clustered games, and helps teams book group experiences during their free time.

The core insight: **Players want to stay together with their teammates. Parents follow their lead. Keeping teams together is what everyone already wants—and it's also where the highest margins are.**

---

## The Problem, Solution & Value Proposition by Stakeholder

### Tournament Directors (TDs)

#### The Problem

Tournament scheduling is a nightmare. TDs juggle a massive matrix of constraints:
- 40-100+ teams across multiple age groups and skill levels
- Limited fields with specific availability windows
- Referee schedules and assignments
- Travel time between fields at multi-venue tournaments
- Pool play matchups that must avoid repeat opponents in brackets

On top of this complexity, **coaches constantly request special scheduling:**
- "We can't play before 10am—families are driving in Friday night."
- "Can we have our games back-to-back so we're done early?"
- "We have a player in two age groups—don't schedule conflicts."

**TDs say no to these requests** because:
1. It's too much manual work to accommodate
2. They don't get compensated for the extra effort
3. Existing tools (spreadsheets, legacy software) don't help

The result: TDs are stressed, coaches are frustrated, and families have bad experiences.

#### The Solution

RoadGame provides a **smart scheduling engine** that handles the complexity algorithmically:

1. **Constraint-based scheduling:** TD inputs teams, fields, time slots, and constraints. The system generates an optimized schedule automatically.

2. **VIP scheduling built-in:** Teams can purchase "VIP scheduling" for clustered games (e.g., 8am, 9:30am, done by 11am). The algorithm handles the optimization—TD doesn't manually juggle.

3. **Approval workflow:** TD reviews and approves the generated schedule. Adjustments are easy—change one thing, system re-optimizes around it.

4. **Results & bracket management:** Live bracket updates, score entry, automatic advancement.

#### The Value Proposition

| Value | What It Means for TDs |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Hours saved** | Algorithm does the hard work. TD reviews and approves instead of building from scratch. |
| **Say yes to requests** | Coaches want clustered games? Offer it as VIP—system handles the complexity. |
| **New revenue stream** | VIP fees split with TD. 20 VIP teams × $150 × 70% = $2,100+ per tournament. |
| **Happier coaches** | Fewer complaints. Special requests are now a paid option, not a favor. |
| **Competitive differentiation** | "Our tournament offers VIP scheduling" attracts teams over competitors. |

**The pitch to TDs:**
> "We solve your scheduling nightmare. The tool does the hard work. And you make money from VIP upsells you couldn't offer before."

---

### Teams (Coaches & Team Moms)

#### The Problem

Tournament weekends are exhausting and wasteful. A typical experience:

- **Game at 10am.** Family arrives at 9am to warm up.
- **Game ends at 11am.** Next game isn't until 4pm.
- **5-hour gap.** Too short to go back to the hotel, too long to sit at the field.
- **Kids are bored.** Glued to iPads, wandering around, getting into trouble.
- **Parents are frustrated.** "We're paying $3,000 for this?"
- **No coordination.** Each family fends for themselves. Team scatters.
- **Game at 4pm.** Everyone reconvenes tired and cranky.
- **Day wasted.** Could have been a great experience. Instead, it was a slog.

And coaches/team moms hear about it:
- "Why is our schedule so spread out?"
- "Can't you request better times?"
- "Other teams seem to be done by noon..."

**Teams have no power over the schedule.** They take what they're given.

#### The Solution

RoadGame offers **VIP Scheduling** as a team-level purchase:

1. **Clustered games:** Team's games are scheduled back-to-back (e.g., 8am, 9:30am → done by 11am). Real, usable free time.

2. **Team buys VIP:** Coach or team mom purchases VIP from team budget ($100-200). Or families split the cost.

3. **Predictable downtime:** Team knows exactly when they're free—not a fragmented, wasted day.

4. **Group experiences:** With predictable free time, the team can book activities TOGETHER. Kids stay with their friends. Parents relax.

#### The Value Proposition

| Value | What It Means for Teams |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Games clustered** | Done by noon OR start at 2pm. Not spread across the entire day. |
| **Usable free time** | 5-hour block to do something real, not awkward 90-minute gaps. |
| **Kids stay together** | Team does activities as a group. Kids are with their friends. |
| **Parents happier** | Actual time to relax, explore, or handle life maintenance. |
| **Worth the cost** | $100-200 is nothing when you're already paying $3K+ for the season. |

**The pitch to teams:**
> "Pay a little extra, get your games clustered, and actually enjoy the weekend. Your kids stay with their friends. You get real free time. It's a no-brainer."

---

### Families & Players

#### The Problem

Tournament weekends should be fun. Instead, they're often:

- **Boring:** Hours of sitting around between games with nothing to do.
- **Fragmented:** Family splits up—one parent stays with player, other takes siblings elsewhere.
- **Unfamiliar:** In a strange city with no idea what's nearby or good.
- **Uncoordinated:** "Where should we eat?" becomes a 30-minute group text debate.
- **Isolating:** Kids end up on devices instead of with their teammates.

Players especially feel this. They **want to be with their friends**—not stuck with just their family or alone with an iPad.

#### The Solution

When the team has VIP scheduling:

1. **Predictable free time:** Player knows "we're done by 11am, next thing is team bowling at 1pm."

2. **Group activities:** Team does things together. Bowling, mini golf, escape room, pool time—whatever it is, they do it as a team.

3. **Easy booking:** Team mom books one reservation for the whole group through RoadGame. No coordination chaos.

4. **Kids with friends:** Players spend the day with their teammates, not isolated with their family.

#### The Value Proposition

| Value | What It Means for Families |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Kids are happy** | With their friends, doing fun things, not bored. |
| **Parents relax** | Know where kids are (with the team). Can actually enjoy the trip. |
| **Memorable weekends** | These become the trips kids remember—not just the games, but the adventures. |
| **Less stress** | No "where should we go?" debates. It's planned. |

**The pitch to families:**
> "Your kid gets to spend the weekend with their best friends—not just at games, but at lunch, at the pool, at the arcade. And you get to actually relax."

---

### Vendors (Restaurants, Activities, Services)

#### The Problem

Tournament weekends bring hundreds of families to town, but vendors can't capitalize:

- **Unpredictable traffic:** Families wander in randomly. Hard to staff for.
- **Small groups:** Individual families of 4-5. Not worth special attention.
- **No reservations:** Families don't know the area, don't plan ahead. Show up and hope.
- **Missed opportunity:** $250/family spent on food/activities, but it's scattered across random places.

#### The Solution

RoadGame delivers **group bookings from entire teams:**

1. **Predictable traffic:** "Team Lightning (22 people) booked for 12:30pm Saturday."

2. **Large groups:** 15-30 people per booking. Worth prioritizing.

3. **Advance notice:** Bookings made days ahead. Vendor can staff and prepare.

4. **Repeat business:** Same teams, same tournaments, year after year.

#### The Value Proposition

| Value | What It Means for Vendors |
|-------|--------------------------|
| **Group bookings** | 20-30 people at once, not individuals trickling in. |
| **Predictable** | Know exactly when to expect them. Staff accordingly. |
| **Higher revenue per visit** | Groups spend more than individual families. |
| **Tournament weekend goldmine** | Capture the spending that's already happening in your area. |

**The pitch to vendors:**
> "Tournament weekends bring 500 families to town. We'll send you 25 of them at once, with a reservation, on Saturday at noon. You in?"

```

**The Flywheel:**

1. TD adopts RoadGame (solves scheduling pain)
2. TD offers VIP scheduling to teams (new revenue)
3. Teams buy VIP (clustered games, better experience)
4. Teams book group experiences (activities, dining)
5. Vendors get group traffic (commit to platform)
6. Better experience → word spreads → more TDs want RoadGame

---

## Revenue Model

| Source | How It Works | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **VIP Scheduling** | Team pays $100-200. RoadGame takes 30%, TD keeps 70%. | 20 teams × $150 × 30% = $900 |
| **Booking Commission** | Vendor pays 10-15% on completed group bookings. | $2,000 in bookings × 12% = $240 |
| **Tournament Total** | Combined revenue per tournament. | $1,000-2,000+ per tournament |

**Scale math:**
- 10 tournaments/month × $1,500 avg = $15,000/month
- 50 tournaments/month × $1,500 avg = $75,000/month

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | What It Validates |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| TD adoption | 1 pilot | Will TDs use the scheduling tool? |
| VIP purchase rate | >25% of teams | Will teams pay for clustered scheduling? |
| Family satisfaction | Qualitative | Do families notice the better experience? |
| Group booking rate | >50% of VIP teams book 1+ experience | Will teams book together? |
| Vendor satisfaction | Qualitative | Do vendors value group bookings? |
| TD revenue | Track | Did TD make meaningful money from VIP? |

---

## Go / No-Go Criteria

### Continue Building If:
- TD finds scheduling tool genuinely useful
- >25% of teams purchase VIP
- At least half of VIP teams book a group experience
- Vendors say "I'd do this again"
- Families/players report better experience

### Pivot If:
- Teams won't pay for VIP (<10% purchase rate)
- Families don't book experiences even with good schedules
- Vendors don't see value in group bookings

### Stop If:
- Can't build scheduling algorithm that works
- TDs won't adopt the tool (prefer existing solutions)
- Fundamental assumption wrong (teams don't want to do things together)

---

## Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Tournament Management Core
The scheduling engine is the foundation. Without it, nothing else works.

- Tournament setup (teams, fields, time slots, constraints)
- Scheduling algorithm with VIP clustering
- Schedule optimization and adjustment tools
- Bracket/pool play management
- Results entry and bracket advancement

### Phase 2: Team Experience
Enable teams to benefit from VIP and book together.

- Team portal with schedule and downtime view
- VIP purchase flow
- Group experience browsing
- Group booking flow
- Itinerary management

### Phase 3: Vendor Integration
Connect vendors to receive group bookings.

- Manual vendor onboarding
- Availability management
- Booking notifications
- Confirmation workflow

### Phase 4: Launch Prep
Execute the pilot.

- Select target tournament
- Recruit 3-5 vendors near venue
- Onboard TD with training
- Test full flow end-to-end
- Launch and monitor

---

## Target Tournament Criteria

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Format | Pool play + bracket (not pure round-robin) |
| Size | 40-80 teams (manageable for V1) |
| Access | Direct relationship with TD |
| Location | Area with group-friendly venues |
| Timing | 12-16 weeks out (need time to build) |

---

## Team Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Technical Lead** | Build the platform: scheduling engine, team portal, vendor integration |
| **TD Liaison** | Recruit pilot TD, manage relationship, gather feedback |
| **Vendor Recruiter** | Sign up 3-5 local vendors for pilot |
| **Operations** | Manual vendor onboarding, booking support during pilot |

---

## Key Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Scheduling algorithm is hard | Start simple (greedy algorithm), iterate. Manual override as fallback. |
| TDs prefer existing tools | Offer free pilot. Let value prove itself. |
| Teams won't pay for VIP | Test pricing. Start at $100. Adjust based on feedback. |
| Vendors won't accept group bookings | Start with venues already group-friendly (bowling, restaurants). |

---

## The Core Insight

> **Players want to stay together with their teammates. Parents follow their lead. Keeping teams together is what everyone already wants—and it's also where the highest margins are.**

This means:
- Don't optimize for individual families
- Optimize for team coordination
- Group dining, group activities, group experiences
- "What is the TEAM doing?" not "What can MY family do?"

---

## Appendix: Market Research

- **Market size:** $52.2B direct spending on youth sports travel
- **Tournament frequency:** 10-15 weekends per year for travel teams
- **Pain points:** Scheduling chaos, wasted downtime, fragmented experiences
- **Spending per trip:** $830 average ($330 lodging, $250 transport, $250 food)
