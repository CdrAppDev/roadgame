# RoadGame V1 Strategy

## Executive Summary

RoadGame is a **smart tournament scheduling system** that delivers **100% field utilization AND 6-8 hours of guaranteed family activity time**—without compromise.

**The insight:** In a 32-team tournament, only 8 teams play at any moment. The other 24 teams are always "free"—but their free time is scattered unpredictably across the day, making it impossible to plan activities. RoadGame solves this by clustering each team's games together, so every team gets a continuous block of guaranteed free time while fields stay full.

**The result:** Max revenue for Tournament Directors. Max experience for families. No trade-off required.

## The Actual Problem

### It's Not "No Free Time"—It's Scattered Free Time

Families already have free time during tournaments. The problem is that free time is **scattered and unpredictable**.

**A typical tournament day:**

| Time | What's Happening |
|------|------------------|
| 8:00 AM | Game 1 |
| 9:30 AM | Done. Next game at... when? |
| 10:00 AM | Check schedule. Next game is 2:00 PM. |
| 10:15 AM | "Should we do something? We have 4 hours..." |
| 10:30 AM | Start researching activities nearby |
| 11:00 AM | Find bowling alley. "But what if the game runs late?" |
| 11:30 AM | Decide it's too risky. Sit at the field. |
| 12:00 PM | Kids are bored. Buy overpriced concessions. |
| 2:00 PM | Game 2 |
| 3:30 PM | Done. Next game is 6:00 PM. Another 2.5 hour gap. |
| 4:00 PM | Too short for real activity. Too long to just wait. |
| 6:00 PM | Game 3. Finally done at 7:30 PM. |

**Total free time:** 6+ hours
**Usable free time:** 0 hours

The free time exists. It's just scattered into 2-3 unpredictable chunks that feel too risky to book around.

### Why Traditional Scheduling Creates This Problem

Traditional tournament scheduling optimizes for **field efficiency**:
- Pack games as tightly as possible
- Minimize gaps between games on each field
- Fill every time slot

This keeps fields running 8 AM to 8 PM with 10-15 minute buffers. Great for field utilization. Terrible for family experience.

But here's what traditional scheduling **doesn't consider**:

> In a 32-team tournament on 4 fields, only 8 teams are playing at any given moment. 24 teams are always free. The question isn't whether families have free time—it's whether that free time is **clustered and predictable** enough to use.

---

## The RoadGame Solution

### Clustered Scheduling: Same Games, Different Organization

RoadGame doesn't reduce games or leave fields empty. It reorganizes **who plays when** so that each team's games are clustered together.

**Traditional scheduling:**
- Team A: Game at 8am, 2pm, 6pm (games scattered across 10 hours)
- Free time: Three 2-3 hour chunks, unpredictable, unusable

**RoadGame scheduling:**
- Team A: Games at 8am, 10am, 12pm (games clustered in morning)
- Free time: 1pm - 8pm (7 continuous hours, predictable, bookable)

**Fields stay full** because while Team A is free in the afternoon, Teams B through P are playing their clustered games.

---

## The RoadGame Format: A Concrete Example

### Tournament Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Teams | 32 |
| Fields | 4 |
| Days | 2 (Saturday-Sunday) |
| Format | Pool Play → Single Elimination Bracket |
| Games guaranteed | 3 pool games per team |

### Day 1 (Saturday): Pool Play

**Structure:** Split teams into Morning Wave and Afternoon Wave. Each team's 3 pool games are scheduled back-to-back.

| Wave | Teams | Time Block | Guaranteed Free Time |
|------|-------|------------|---------------------|
| Morning Wave | 16 teams (Pools A & B) | 8 AM - 1 PM | **1 PM - 9 PM (8 hours)** |
| Afternoon Wave | 16 teams (Pools C & D) | 2 PM - 7 PM | **8 AM - 2 PM (6 hours)** |

**Field utilization:** 8 AM - 7 PM = 11 hours × 4 fields = **100% utilized**

**Game math:**
- 32 teams × 3 games each = 96 team-game slots = 48 actual games needed
- Morning wave: 4 fields × 6 games = 24 games
- Afternoon wave: 4 fields × 6 games = 24 games
- Total: 48 games ✓

**Family experience:**
- Morning Wave families know before the tournament: "Your games are 8 AM - 1 PM. You're free 1 PM onwards. Book activities for 2 PM."
- Afternoon Wave families know before the tournament: "You're free until 2 PM. Book brunch and mini-golf for 9 AM - 12 PM."

### Day 2 (Sunday): Bracket Play

**Structure:** Top 2 from each pool advance (8 teams). Bracket games have intentional breaks built in.

| Round | Time | Teams Playing | What Others Do |
|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| Quarterfinals | 8 AM - 10 AM | 8 advancing teams | 24 eliminated teams: free day or consolation games |
| **Activity Window** | 10 AM - 1 PM | Fields run consolation bracket | **8 advancing teams: guaranteed 3-hour break** |
| Semifinals | 1 PM - 3 PM | 4 teams | 4 teams wait for finals/3rd place |
| Finals | 4 PM - 6 PM | 2-4 teams | Tournament concludes |

**Field utilization:** Consolation bracket games fill the 10 AM - 1 PM window while advancing teams have their activity break. **Fields stay full.**

**The insight:** The "gap" for advancing teams isn't wasted field time—it's filled by consolation games for non-advancing teams. Everyone's free time is predictable, and fields never sit empty.

### The Result: No Trade-Offs

| Metric | Traditional Format | RoadGame Format |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Field utilization | 100% | 100% |
| Total games played | 48 pool + 7 bracket | 48 pool + 7 bracket |
| Teams accommodated | 32 | 32 |
| TD revenue | Entry fees only | Entry fees + VIP upsells |
| Guaranteed free time per team | 0 hours (scattered) | **6-8 hours (continuous)** |
| Booking confidence | 0% (too risky) | **100% (published in advance)** |

---

## Why This Works

### The Math Behind Clustered Scheduling

In any tournament:
- **N teams** competing
- **F fields** available
- At any moment, only **2F teams** are playing (2 teams per field)
- **N - 2F teams** are always free

For a 32-team, 4-field tournament:
- 8 teams playing at any moment
- 24 teams free at any moment

Traditional scheduling scatters those 24 teams' free time randomly. RoadGame clustering organizes it into predictable blocks.

**The magic:** We're not creating free time. We're not reducing games. We're reorganizing the same games so that each team's free time is continuous instead of fragmented.

### Wave Assignment Makes It Simple

Teams are assigned to waves at registration:
- **Morning Wave:** All your pool games are 8 AM - 1 PM
- **Afternoon Wave:** All your pool games are 2 PM - 7 PM

This is published **before the tournament**. Families can book activities with 100% confidence because they know their wave assignment days in advance.

## Value Proposition by Stakeholder

### Tournament Directors

**The Problem:**
Tournament scheduling is complex. TDs juggle constraints (fields, refs, brackets) while fielding requests from coaches who want clustered games. Current tools don't support intelligent clustering, so TDs say no to requests and families have bad experiences.

**The Solution:**
RoadGame's scheduling engine handles clustering automatically. TD inputs teams, fields, and constraints. System outputs a schedule where every team's games are clustered and every team has predictable free time—while fields stay 100% utilized.

**The Value:**

| Benefit | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Same revenue | Same number of teams, same entry fees, 100% field utilization |
| New revenue stream | VIP wave selection: teams pay extra to choose Morning or Afternoon wave |
| Less manual work | Algorithm handles clustering complexity |
| Happier families | Predictable schedules = fewer complaints |
| Competitive advantage | "RoadGame Format" tournaments attract teams over traditional tournaments |

**The pitch:**
> "Same games, same fields, same revenue—but now every family gets 6-8 hours of guaranteed free time. And teams will pay extra to pick their wave."

---

### Teams (Coaches & Team Moms)

**The Problem:**
Tournament weekends are exhausting. Games are scattered across the day. Kids are bored between games. Parents are frustrated. Team moms can't coordinate group activities because no one knows when they'll actually be free.

**The Solution:**
In RoadGame Format tournaments, every team's games are clustered. Morning Wave teams play 8-1, free after. Afternoon Wave teams are free until 2, then play. Published in advance. 100% predictable.

**The Value:**

| Benefit | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Games clustered | Done by 1 PM or start at 2 PM. Not scattered across 10 hours. |
| 6-8 hours free | Continuous block. Enough time for real activities. |
| Published in advance | Know your wave before the tournament. Book activities with confidence. |
| Team coordination | Everyone on the team has the same free window. Do activities together. |

**The pitch:**
> "Your team plays 8-1, done. Everyone's free 1-8 PM. Book the team bowling outing at 3 PM. It's guaranteed."

---

### Families & Players

**The Problem:**
Kids spend tournament days bored between games. Too risky to book activities because "what if our next game conflicts?" They end up on iPads at the field instead of having fun with their teammates.

**The Solution:**
RoadGame Format means predictable free time. Players know before the weekend: "We're Morning Wave. Saturday we're free after 1 PM. The team is going bowling at 3."

**The Value:**

| Benefit | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Kids with teammates | Team does activities together during their shared free window |
| Memorable weekends | These become trips kids remember—not just games, but adventures |
| Parents relax | Know exactly when kids are free. Plan accordingly. No uncertainty. |
| Actually use the city | 6-8 hours is enough time to explore, not just sit at the field |

**The pitch:**
> "Tournament weekends become actual vacations. Your kid spends the day with their best friends—at games AND at the pool, the arcade, the restaurant."

---

### Vendors (Restaurants, Activities, Services)

**The Problem:**
Tournament weekends bring hundreds of families to town, but vendors can't capitalize. Families have unpredictable schedules, so they wander in randomly or don't come at all.

**The Solution:**
RoadGame Format creates predictable waves. Morning Wave teams (16 teams, ~200 people) are all free 1-8 PM. Vendors can market specifically to them.

**The Value:**

| Benefit | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Predictable traffic | "16 teams are free starting at 1 PM on Saturday" |
| Group bookings | Teams book together. 20-30 people at once. |
| Advance notice | Bookings made days before. Staff accordingly. |
| Repeat business | Same tournament, same waves, every year |

**The pitch:**
> "200 people are guaranteed to be free at 1 PM Saturday. Want to be the activity they book?"

## Revenue Model

### Tournament Director Revenue

| Source | How It Works | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Entry fees | Same as traditional (no reduction in teams) | 32 teams × $500 = $16,000 |
| VIP Wave Selection | Teams pay premium to choose Morning or Afternoon wave | 10 teams × $100 = $1,000 |
| **Total** | | **$17,000** (+6% over traditional) |

### RoadGame Revenue

| Source | How It Works | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Platform fee | Per-team fee from TD | 32 teams × $10 = $320 |
| Booking commission | 10-15% on group experience bookings | $2,000 bookings × 12% = $240 |
| **Total per tournament** | | **$560** |

**Scale math:**
- 50 tournaments/month × $560 = $28,000/month
- 200 tournaments/month × $560 = $112,000/month

**The Flywheel:**

1. TD adopts RoadGame Format (same revenue, better experience)
2. Teams get predictable free time (can actually book activities)
3. Teams book group experiences (bowling, dining, activities)
4. Vendors get reliable group traffic (commit to platform)
5. Better experience → word spreads → more TDs adopt RoadGame Format

## V1 Scope

V1 is a **single-tournament pilot** to validate that:
- Clustered scheduling works operationally
- Families notice and value the predictable free time
- Teams actually book activities during their free windows
- Vendors value the predictable group traffic

### Core Features for V1

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Wave assignment | Assign teams to Morning or Afternoon wave |
| Clustered schedule generation | Algorithm creates schedule where each team's games are back-to-back |
| Published free windows | Communicate to teams: "You're Morning Wave. Free 1 PM - 8 PM." |
| Group booking | Teams can browse and book activities for their free window |
| Vendor notification | Vendors receive bookings with group size and time |

### Not in V1

- Multiple simultaneous tournaments
- Self-service vendor portal (manual onboarding for V1)
- Online payment processing (manual invoicing for V1)
- Mobile app (web only)

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | What It Validates |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Field utilization | 100% | Clustered scheduling doesn't waste field time |
| Games played | Same as traditional | No reduction in tournament size |
| Family satisfaction | >80% positive | Families notice the better experience |
| Activity booking rate | >30% of teams book 1+ activity | Predictable free time leads to bookings |
| TD satisfaction | Would use again | Format works operationally |

---

## Go / No-Go Criteria

### Continue Building If:
- 100% field utilization maintained
- Families report significantly better experience than traditional tournaments
- >30% of teams book at least one group activity
- TD would use RoadGame Format again

### Pivot If:
- Clustering creates operational problems we can't solve
- Families don't book activities even with predictable free time
- Vendors don't see value in the predictable traffic

### Stop If:
- Can't achieve 100% field utilization with clustered scheduling
- TDs won't adopt the format (prefer traditional scattered scheduling)
- Fundamental assumption wrong (families don't actually want to do activities)

---

## Key Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Clustering algorithm is complex | Start with simple wave assignment. Iterate from there. |
| TDs resist new format | Show the math: same revenue, better experience. Pilot proves it. |
| Families don't book activities | Reduce friction. Team mom books for whole team. Curated options. |
| Weather disrupts schedule | Buffer time between waves handles delays without cascade. |

---

## The Core Insight

> **The free time already exists. It's just scattered. RoadGame clusters it.**

Traditional tournaments accidentally create 6-8 hours of free time per team—but scatter it into unusable fragments. RoadGame Format deliberately organizes that same time into predictable, continuous blocks.

**No trade-off required:**
- Fields stay 100% utilized
- Same number of games played
- Same revenue for TDs
- Families get 6-8 hours of guaranteed, bookable free time

That's the RoadGame Format: **Max revenue AND max experience.**

---

## Appendix: Market Research

- **Market size:** $52.2B direct spending on youth sports travel
- **Tournament frequency:** 10-15 weekends per year for travel teams
- **Spending per trip:** $830 average ($330 lodging, $250 transport, $250 food)
- **The opportunity:** Families are spending $250/weekend on food and activities with no coordination. RoadGame captures that spend by making it bookable.
