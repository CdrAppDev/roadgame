# RoadGame V1 Strategy

## Executive Summary

RoadGame is a **smart tournament scheduling system** that delivers **100% field utilization AND 5-9 hours of guaranteed family activity time**—without compromise.

**The insight:** In any tournament, most teams are NOT playing at any given moment. A 16-team tournament on 4 fields has only 8 teams playing at once—the other 8 are "free." But traditional scheduling scatters that free time unpredictably across the day. RoadGame clusters each team's games together, creating continuous, bookable free time while fields stay full.

**The result:** Max revenue for Tournament Directors. Max experience for families. Exposed to any major youth sport.

## The Actual Problem

### It's Not "No Free Time"—It's Scattered Free Time

Families already have free time during tournaments. The problem is that free time is **scattered and unpredictable**.

**A typical tournament day:**

| Time | What's Happening |
|------|------------------|
| 8:00 AM | Game 1 |
| 9:30 AM | Done. Next game at... when? |
| 10:00 AM | Check schedule. Next game is 2:00 PM. |
| 10:15 AM | "Should we do something? We have 4 hours..." |
| 11:00 AM | Find bowling alley. "But what if the game runs late?" |
| 11:30 AM | Decide it's too risky. Sit at the field. |
| 12:00 PM | Kids are bored. Buy overpriced concessions. |
| 2:00 PM | Game 2 |
| 3:30 PM | Done. Next game is 6:00 PM. Another 2.5 hour gap. |
| 6:00 PM | Game 3. Finally done at 7:30 PM. |

**Total free time:** 6+ hours
**Usable free time:** 0 hours

The free time exists. It's just scattered into 2-3 unpredictable chunks that feel too risky to book around.

### Why Traditional Scheduling Creates This

Traditional tournament scheduling optimizes for **field efficiency**: pack games tightly, minimize gaps between games on each field, fill every time slot.

This keeps fields running 8 AM to 8 PM. Great for field utilization. Terrible for family experience.

But here's what traditional scheduling misses:

> In a 16-team tournament on 4 fields, only 8 teams are playing at any given moment. 8 teams are always free. The question isn't whether families have free time—it's whether that free time is **clustered and predictable** enough to use.

---

## The RoadGame Solution

### Clustered Scheduling: Same Games, Different Organization

RoadGame doesn't reduce games or leave fields empty. It reorganizes **who plays when** so that each team's games are clustered together.

**Traditional scheduling:**
- Team A: Games at 8am, 2pm, 6pm (scattered across 10 hours)
- Free time: Three 2-3 hour chunks, unpredictable, unusable

**RoadGame scheduling:**
- Team A: Games at 8am, 9:30am, 11am (clustered in morning)
- Free time: 12pm - 9pm (9 continuous hours, predictable, bookable)

**Fields stay full** because while Team A is free in the afternoon, other teams are playing their clustered afternoon games.

---

## Proof: The RoadGame Format Works Across All Major Youth Sports

We've validated the math for every popular youth travel sport. The wave structure works regardless of game length—you just adjust tournament size accordingly.

### The Universal Formula

```
Wave Window (hours) ÷ Game Slot (hours) = Games per Field per Wave
Games per Field × Number of Fields = Total Games per Wave
Total Games × 2 teams ÷ 3 games per team = Teams per Wave
Teams per Wave × 2 = Total Tournament Size
```

## Detailed Example: Soccer Tournament

Let's walk through a complete 16-team soccer tournament to show exactly how this works.

### Tournament Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Teams | 16 |
| Fields | 4 |
| Days | 2 (Saturday-Sunday) |
| Format | Pool Play → Single Elimination |
| Pool structure | 4 pools of 4 teams |
| Games per team | 3 pool games (round robin) |
| Game slot | 70 min |

### Day 1 (Saturday): Pool Play

**Morning Wave — Pools A & B (8 teams, 12 games)**

| Time | Field 1 | Field 2 | Field 3 | Field 4 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 8:00 AM | A1 vs A2 | A3 vs A4 | B1 vs B2 | B3 vs B4 |
| 9:10 AM | A1 vs A3 | A2 vs A4 | B1 vs B3 | B2 vs B4 |
| 10:20 AM | A1 vs A4 | A2 vs A3 | B1 vs B4 | B2 vs B3 |

**Morning Wave done: 11:30 AM**
**Morning teams free: 11:30 AM - 9:00 PM (9.5 hours)**

---

**Afternoon Wave — Pools C & D (8 teams, 12 games)**

| Time | Field 1 | Field 2 | Field 3 | Field 4 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 12:30 PM | C1 vs C2 | C3 vs C4 | D1 vs D2 | D3 vs D4 |
| 1:40 PM | C1 vs C3 | C2 vs C4 | D1 vs D3 | D2 vs D4 |
| 2:50 PM | C1 vs C4 | C2 vs C3 | D1 vs D4 | D2 vs D3 |

**Afternoon Wave done: 4:00 PM**
**Afternoon teams free: 8:00 AM - 12:30 PM (4.5 hours)**

---

### Day 2 (Sunday): Bracket Play

Top 2 from each pool advance → 8 teams in bracket

| Time | Round | Fields Used | What's Happening |
|------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| 8:00 AM | Quarterfinals | 4 fields | 8 advancing teams play |
| 9:10 AM | QF ends | — | — |
| 9:10 AM - 12:30 PM | **Activity Window** | 4 fields (consolation) | **Advancing teams: 3+ hour break** |
| 12:30 PM | Semifinals | 2 fields | 4 teams play |
| 1:40 PM | SF ends | — | — |
| 2:30 PM | Finals + 3rd Place | 2 fields | Championship games |
| 3:40 PM | Tournament ends | — | — |

**Field utilization:** Consolation bracket (for non-advancing teams) runs during the 9:10 AM - 12:30 PM window, keeping fields active while advancing teams have their guaranteed activity break.

---

### The Result

| Metric | Traditional | RoadGame Format |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Teams | 16 | 16 |
| Fields | 4 | 4 |
| Total games | 24 pool + 7 bracket | 24 pool + 7 bracket |
| Field utilization | ~85% | ~85% |
| Guaranteed free time | 0 hrs (scattered) | **5-9.5 hrs (continuous)** |
| Booking confidence | 0% | **100%** |

---

## Why This Works: The Math

### The Core Equation

In any tournament:
- **N teams** competing
- **F fields** available
- At any moment, only **2F teams** are playing
- **N - 2F teams** are always free

For a 16-team, 4-field tournament:
- 8 teams playing at any moment
- 8 teams free at any moment

Traditional scheduling scatters those 8 teams' free time randomly. RoadGame organizes it into predictable waves.

### Wave Assignment

Teams are assigned to waves at registration:
- **Morning Wave:** All your pool games are in the morning block
- **Afternoon Wave:** All your pool games are in the afternoon block

This is published **before the tournament**. Families book activities with 100% confidence.

---

## Value Proposition by Stakeholder

### Tournament Directors

**The Problem:** Scheduling is complex. Coaches request clustered games. TDs say no because current tools don't help.

**The Solution:** RoadGame generates clustered schedules automatically. Same games, same fields, same revenue—with predictable family free time built in.

| Benefit | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Same revenue | Same teams, same entry fees, same field utilization |
| New revenue | VIP wave selection: teams pay to choose their wave |
| Less work | Algorithm handles complexity |
| Happier families | Predictable schedules = fewer complaints |
| Differentiation | "RoadGame Format" attracts teams |

---

### Teams (Coaches & Team Moms)

**The Problem:** Games scattered across the day. Can't coordinate group activities.

**The Solution:** Every team's games are clustered. Morning or Afternoon wave, published in advance.

| Benefit | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Games clustered | Done by noon OR start after noon |
| 5-9 hours free | Continuous block for real activities |
| Published in advance | Book activities before the tournament |
| Team coordination | Everyone free at the same time |

---

### Families & Players

**The Problem:** Kids bored between games. Too risky to book activities.

**The Solution:** Predictable free time. Know your wave, book with confidence.

| Benefit | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Kids with teammates | Do activities together |
| Memorable weekends | Adventures, not just games |
| Parents relax | Know exactly when free |

---

### Vendors

**The Problem:** Tournament families have unpredictable schedules.

**The Solution:** Predictable waves = predictable traffic.

| Benefit | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Predictable traffic | "8 teams free at noon" |
| Group bookings | 20-30 people at once |
| Advance notice | Book days ahead |

---

## Revenue Model

### Tournament Director Revenue

| Source | How It Works | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Entry fees | Same as traditional | 16 teams × $500 = $8,000 |
| VIP Wave Selection | Teams pay to choose wave | 5 teams × $100 = $500 |
| **Total** | | **$8,500** |

### RoadGame Revenue

| Source | How It Works | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Platform fee | Per-team fee | 16 teams × $10 = $160 |
| Booking commission | 12% on group bookings | $1,500 × 12% = $180 |
| **Total per tournament** | | **$340** |

---

## V1 Scope

### Pilot Validation

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Field utilization | Same as traditional (~85%) |
| Family satisfaction | >80% positive |
| Activity booking rate | >30% of teams book 1+ activity |
| TD satisfaction | Would use again |

---

## Why Hasn't This Been Done Before?

If clustering games is so straightforward, why isn't everyone already doing it?

### 1. Software optimizes for the wrong thing

Tournament scheduling software (TeamSnap, Fastbreak AI, SportsEngine) optimizes for **field efficiency** and **constraint satisfaction**—avoid coach conflicts, balance travel times, maximize field usage.

None of them optimize for **family experience**. "Cluster each team's games together" isn't even a parameter in these systems.

### 2. TDs have no financial incentive

Tournament Directors get paid to fill fields and run tournaments smoothly. They don't get compensated for family happiness. When coaches request clustered games, TDs see it as extra manual work with no payoff—so they say no.

### 3. No marketplace on the other end

Even if a TD manually clustered games, families wouldn't know what to DO with predictable free time. There's no easy way to discover and book group activities. You need both sides: **predictable time + easy booking**. Neither existed together.

### 4. "That's just how it's done"

Tournament formats haven't fundamentally changed in 30+ years. Pool play + bracket. The assumption is that scattered games are inevitable—a side effect of field optimization. Nobody questioned whether there's a better way to organize WHO plays WHEN.

### 5. Families don't know to ask

Parents complain about wasted time at tournaments, but they assume that's just how it works. They don't know an alternative is possible, so they don't demand it.

### 6. The connection was never made

"Scheduling" and "family experience" have always been treated as separate problems. Tournament software solves scheduling. Yelp/Google solve "what to do." Nobody connected them: **scheduling IS the lever that unlocks experience**.

### Why Now?

| Factor | What Changed |
|--------|--------------|
| **Algorithms** | Modern constraint-satisfaction algorithms can optimize for multiple variables, including team clustering |
| **Marketplaces** | Group booking platforms make coordinating 20+ people frictionless |
| **Post-COVID mindset** | Families are more intentional about quality time together |
| **TD competition** | Tournament Directors looking for differentiation and new revenue streams |
| **Mobile-first** | Real-time schedule updates and booking possible on phones at the field |

**RoadGame connects scheduling to experience.** That's the innovation—not the algorithm, but the insight that these two problems are actually one.

---

## The Core Insight

> **The free time already exists. It's just scattered. RoadGame clusters it.**

Traditional tournaments create 5-9 hours of free time per team—but scatter it into unusable fragments. RoadGame Format organizes that same time into predictable, continuous blocks.

**No trade-off required:**
- Fields stay utilized
- Same number of games
- Same revenue for TDs
- Families get 5-9 hours of guaranteed, bookable free time

**That's the RoadGame Format: Max revenue AND max experience.**

---

## Appendix: Scaling

### Larger Tournaments

The wave structure scales with more fields:

| Teams | Fields Needed | Structure |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| 16 | 4 | 2 waves of 8 teams |
| 24 | 6 | 2 waves of 12 teams |
| 32 | 8 | 2 waves of 16 teams |
| 48 | 8 | 3 days instead of 2 |

### Sport-Specific Notes

- **Baseball/Softball:** Longer games mean smaller tournaments OR more fields
- **Basketball:** Shorter games allow larger tournaments on same courts
- **Ice Hockey:** Limited rinks constrain tournament size

---

## Appendix: Market Research

- **Market size:** $52.2B direct spending on youth sports travel
- **Tournament frequency:** 10-15 weekends per year for travel teams
- **Spending per trip:** $830 average ($330 lodging, $250 transport, $250 food)
- **The opportunity:** Families spend $250/weekend on food and activities with no coordination. RoadGame makes it bookable.
